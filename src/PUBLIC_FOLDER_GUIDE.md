# Public Folder Structure for Vercel Deployment

## ✅ Current Structure (Clean & Production Ready)

The `public/` folder is now properly structured for Vercel deployment:

```
public/
├── favicon.ico          # Browser favicon (placeholder)
├── manifest.json        # PWA manifest file  
├── robots.txt           # SEO robots file
├── sitemap.xml          # SEO sitemap
├── sw.js               # Service worker for PWA
├── og-image.svg        # Open Graph social media image
└── unsubscribe.html    # Static unsubscribe redirect page
```

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Ready

### Key Features:
- ✅ **No `.tsx` files** - All React components removed from public/
- ✅ **Proper static files** - Only static assets that browsers can serve

   ```

2. **Manual via Vercel CLI:**

   ```

3. **Using deployment script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/vercel-deploy.sh
